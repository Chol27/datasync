midterm project optimization for data sync

to run this in your local server you can run

`source ./.setup`

#

For database there are some shorthand provided in database folder by run

`source ./.source`

then you will got following command alias

`list-state` which would list all dump file we have in `seed-data` folder

`save-state arg` and `load-state arg` which would save and load dump file

`set-index` which would set cluster index you can edit in `index.sql`
